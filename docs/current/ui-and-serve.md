# the UI and serve

`vane serve --port N` (default 4114) presents the localhost board: bound to `127.0.0.1` only, repository-level fail-fast at startup (missing/unreadable roadmap directory, unreadable order.yaml), graceful shutdown on signal. The ogen server mounts at `/api/v1`; a small middleware routes `/api/*` there and serves the embedded SPA for everything else, falling back to `index.html`. `-tags no_ui` builds a headless binary whose middleware serves the API and says plainly that the board wasn't built in.

`ui/` follows the flo pattern: Vite + TypeScript + React 19, built into `dist/` and embedded via `go:embed all:dist` (builds not committed; `make build` runs the frontend first). The TypeScript client is generated from the same contract the server is — `npm run gen:api` runs `openapi-typescript` against `internal/api/specs/vane.yml` into `src/api/schema.d.ts`, and all calls go through `openapi-fetch` in a thin `src/api.ts` — so the server contract and the client types cannot diverge. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to a running `vane serve` for the hot-reload loop. Everything is self-contained: the house fonts (Source Serif 4 and Source Code Pro, via bundled `@fontsource` packages), the Material Design icons (inlined SVG paths), and the map-mark favicon all ride into the binary — no CDN fetch, fully offline.

## the surface

Light theme, driven by CSS variables at the top of `src/style.css`.

- **Board** — seven lanes in lifecycle order. Cards show the title (or the filename when the title is unreadable), the item's tags as colored label chips (sorted for display; file order untouched), flag badges with the diagnostic on hover, and log stamps as compact `stamp — note` lines. A dashed rule marks each lane's ranked/unranked boundary. Manual browser refresh is the freshness contract; no polling. Label colors live in `src/labels.ts`: the house vocabulary (defect, documentation, enhancement, epic, feature, spike, story, plus product labels) carries fixed colors matched to the practice's forge boards; any other tag derives a stable color from its text, so labels read consistently everywhere with zero configuration.
- **Drag** — `@dnd-kit/core` + sortable, fully telegraphed: a floating copy of the card follows the pointer (`DragOverlay`), crossing into another lane live-moves the card so the destination opens a slot, and drops apply optimistically — the card stays where it lands while the gesture runs, and the server's fresh board replaces the preview when it returns. Gestures always compute against the pre-drag server-truth snapshot (hashes, order version, on-disk ranked counts), never the preview; a failed drop restores the snapshot and reloads. A within-lane drop PUTs the lane's resulting ranked prefix (an unranked card ranks alone; tail drops serialize as end-of-ranked-list); a cross-lane drop is transition-and-place.
- **Item modal** — click a card for a centered, fixed-size modal (`min(80vh, 56rem)` tall): the body renders as markdown (react-markdown + GFM), with state/created/tags/source/filename as a meta row and flags/log below the title. Click the title to retitle in place (Enter commits the full two-file gesture, Escape/blur cancels). The pencil icon opens edit mode: the raw file bytes — frontmatter included — in a word-wrapped textarea, saved verbatim through the hash guard. `rename to slug` appears only on mismatch-flagged cards. Escape or a backdrop click closes.
- **Capture** — the plus icon in the header; title + optional body in a modal sized identically to the item modal, landing in inbox.
- **Conflicts** — every mutation resolves through one outcome path. `item_conflict`/`order_conflict`: a dismissable notice ("changed on disk — reloaded") and a board refetch. `slug_collision`: the capture modal and item modal keep their content on screen and show the structured recovery paths — the preserved `.capture-` draft for capture, source and colliding destination for the renames. Validation refusals show inline with nothing written. Partial two-file failure and any other fault surface the server's message verbatim.

## build and versioning

`make build` = the frontend (npm install + build) then `go install ./...`, per the archive repo's Makefile shape; `make headless` installs with `no_ui` and no frontend step; `make generate` regenerates both sides of the contract (ogen server code, TypeScript schema) from `specs/vane.yml`; `make test` runs the Go suite uncached plus `go vet` (UI tests run via `npm test` in `ui/`); `make clean` removes the installed binary, `dist/`, and `node_modules/`; `make push` vendors the installed binary into the push depot.

Versioning follows the terminus pattern on `github.com/michaelquigley/push/build`: `vane version` prints the figlet banner and build detail, ldflags-stamped for released builds, `v0.1.x [developer build]` otherwise.
